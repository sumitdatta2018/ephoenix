            It was 2005. Since his college days our respected President Mr. RANAJIT SASMAL had a dream of mordernizing the conventional way of education in the pastoral place like Baradongal. The President with his own efforts transformed the dream into reality and set up "Alakbartika Study Centre"
            only with his 30 pupils.
            He started his long journey thereafter. In 2012 his another contribution in the field of rural accomplishments is "BARADONGAL PHOENIX EDUCATIONAL SOCIETY" that brightened the horizon of new era.
            Beside this traditional move he started the Computer Training Institute to get the students up to date with the newly technical world in the same year .This educational hub has made its appearance with the name of "The Phoenix" since 2017.
            As a result, thousands of students in our area were benifited unexpectedly.
            And the flight of "The Phoenix" is soaring still with its restless wings.
